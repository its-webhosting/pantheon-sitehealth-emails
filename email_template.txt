=== PANTHEON PLAN RECOMMENDATION

Please look at your website's "Pantheon visitors" below -- and
also U-M Pantheon pricing
<https://its.umich.edu/computing/web-mobile/pantheon/pricing> --
to decide if you want to make any changes to your website's hosting
plan to save money:

  * Upgrade to a higher plan
    <https://admin.webservices.umich.edu/sites/{{portal_site_id}}/plan/>
    when you think "Pantheon visitors" will be greater than "Upgrade at"
    in more than 50% of future months.
  {% if current_plan == 'Basic' %}
  * {{site_name}} is already on Basic, the lowest plan.  There is
    no cheaper plan to downgrade to.
  {% elif current_plan == 'Performance Small' %}
  * Downgrade to Basic
  <https://admin.webservices.umich.edu/sites/{{portal_site_id}}/plan/>
  if you decide you no longer need Performance plan features.
  <https://its.umich.edu/computing/web-mobile/pantheon/features>
  {% else %}
  * Downgrade to a lower plan
    <https://admin.webservices.umich.edu/sites/{{portal_site_id}}/plan/>
    if you think "Pantheon visitors" will be less than "Downgrade at"
    in more than 50% of future months.
  {% endif %}
  * NOTE: This report analyzes Pantheon visitors
    <https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/account-mgmt/traffic#how-do-you-know-if-a-visit-counts>
    which are much lower than daily website visitors.

  * These numbers are best estimates. The actual numbers on Pantheon bills
    will be different.


=== SITE TRAFFIC

A chart showing Pantheon website traffic over time is available in the
HTML version of this email.  The data is presented in list form, below.

{{site_name}} Pantheon Traffic
{{site_url}}

{% for row in traffic_table_rows %}
{{traffic_table_rows[row]['month'] | upper}}{% for column in traffic_table_columns[1:] %}
  {{"{:>20}".format(column['label'])}}: {{"{:>25}".format(traffic_table_rows[row][column['name']]|striptags)}}{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
{% if current_month_estimate != '' %}{{current_month_estimate}}{% endif %}
Traffic is as of {{traffic_date}}.

{% if months_until_recommendations == 0 %}
{{site_name}} Estimated Plan Costs
{{estimate_start_date}} -- {{estimate_end_date}}

{% for row in cost_table_rows %}
{{cost_table_rows[row]['plan'] | upper}}{% for column in cost_table_columns[1:] %}
  {{"{:>20}".format(column['label'])}}: {{"{:>20}".format(cost_table_rows[row][column['name']]|striptags)}}{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
as of {{traffic_date}}

Same Traffic Cost
      Estimated cost of the website if it gets the same number of
      "Pantheon visitors" in each of the next 12 months that it did in
      the same month of the previous year.

Median Traffic Cost
     Estimated cost of the website if it gets {{median_monthly_visitors}}
     "Pantheon visitors" every month for the next 12 months.  In the
     past 12 months, half the months had more than {{median_monthly_visitors}}
     "Pantheon visitors" and half had fewer.
     
ITS will generally use the higher of the two estimates. To determine
what plan a site should be on for a given level of traffic, use the
Estimated Pantheon Website Cost graph
<https://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/4705>
{% else %}
{{site_name}} Estimated Plan Costs
{{estimate_start_date}} -- {{estimate_end_date}}

Cost estimates will be available once the site has five months of
Pantheon traffic data.
